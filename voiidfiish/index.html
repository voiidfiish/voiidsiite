    <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>
    
    <p>I am completely restarting this website since I haven't touched it in a year and have forgotten everything I learned about HTML.</p>

    <p>I hope to create my own little corner of the internet to showcase my writing, art, collections, and have a little blog or something.</p>

    <p>I'd also like to join some webrings and really get into indie web type stuff!</p>

    <p>I am brand new to HTML/CSS/JS so this is going to be a learning project for me.</p>
